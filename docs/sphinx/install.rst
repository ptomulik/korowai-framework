Installing Korowai Framework
============================

Use composer_ to install the framework or some of its components.

To install whole Korowai Framework for your project, type

.. code-block:: shell

      php composer.phar require "korowai/framework:dev-master"

If you only need a component, for example ``korowai/ldap``, then

.. code-block:: shell

      php composer.phar require "korowai/ldap:dev-master"

.. note::

   We have not released Korowai Framework yet, so it's only installable from
   github_.

.. _composer: https://getcomposer.org/
.. _github: https://github.com/korowai/framework/
