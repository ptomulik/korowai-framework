## Why Korowai?

The Korowai, also called the Kolufo, are the people who live in southeastern
West Papua in the Indonesian Province of Papua, close to the border with Papua
New Guinea. The majority of the Korowai clans live in tree houses on their
isolated territory.

Korowai life highly dependent on trees. Similarly, some admins' work depends on
